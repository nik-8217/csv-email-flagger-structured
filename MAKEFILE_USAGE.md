## Common Workflows

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initial setup
make setup deps

# 2. Run tests to ensure everything works
make test

# 3. Start development server
make dev
# OR
make run
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Quick test during development
make quick-test
```

### Build & Deploy Workflow

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Create release package
make release

# Docker deployment
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```bash
# Setup
make setup deps

# Code quality
make fmt lint

# Testing
make test-coverage

# Building
make build-all

# Docker
make docker-build
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can override default values by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Change port
PORT=3000 make run

# Change process mode
PROCESS_MODE=parallel make run

# Change Docker tag
DOCKER_TAG=v1.0.0 make docker-build
```

### Custom Configuration

Edit the Makefile variables at the top:

```makefile
BINARY_NAME=csv-email-flagger
BUILD_DIR=build
DOCKER_IMAGE=csv-email-flagger
DOCKER_TAG=latest
PORT=8080
PROCESS_MODE=sequential
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Go version mismatch**
   ```bash
   # Check Go version
   go version
   
   # Update go.mod if needed
   # Edit go.mod to match your Go version
   ```

2. **Dependencies not found**
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```

3. **Build fails**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make deps
   make build
   ```

4. **Tests fail**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make test-verbose
   ```

5. **Docker build fails**
   ```bash
   # Check Docker is running
   docker --version
   
   # Clean Docker cache
   docker system prune
   
   # Rebuild
   make docker-build
   ```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show all commands
make help

# Check project status
make status

# Run verbose tests for debugging
make test-verbose
```

## Examples

### Complete Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd csv-email-flagger-structured
make setup deps

# Verify everything works
make test

# Start development
make run
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build and test
make clean test build

# Docker deployment
make docker-build
make docker-run-parallel

# Or install locally
make install
```

### Release Process

```bash
# Full release build

# Check release contents
ls -la release/
```
